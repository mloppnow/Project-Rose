# Author's: Adikan/Melanie
Project Rose is a virtual table-top game that combines aspects of both
traditional strategic board games (Risk) and classic deck builders (Yu-Gi-Oh, Hearthstone).
The game is based around the 2nd episode of the Rooster Teeth webseries RWBY and is inspired
by a short scene in Season 2, Episode 2 (Welcome to Beacon). The episode features a short scene
where the main protagonists are pit against eachother in a tactical board game (called Remnant). A handful of 
rules were established in the scene, but for the most part the game is left undefined. 

Purpose: Project Rose seeks to bring to life the boardgame of Remnant online. 

Requirements: 
	1) Maintain accuracy between the Game and the pre existing RWBY universe
	2) Combine elements of both a tactical Board game and a trading card game in a manner that has both depth and is enjoyable
	3) Provide full decks for each of the Four kingdoms that are balanced
	4) Implmement the Grimm and the Wall of the kingdoms into the Game
	5) Develop a in game rule book that defines the parameters and structure of the game

Goals:
	1) Support Lan Coop
	2) Implment AI so that players can play the game with less than 3 other players
	3) Implmenent individual Models for each playable card
	4) Implmenent particle effects for each effect card
	5) Support online play
	6) Create a deck building system
